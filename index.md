summary: "The Application Administrator tool is just one part of a larger system called the Mobile Application Platform. Note in the graphic below how the Platform and Tools work together."
---

You can use this secure and completely integrated system to do the following:
* The Application Server uses web services and communicates with the Application Administrator tool and the Adapter Designer. All metadata in the metadata database is available through the combination of the Application Administrator tool and the Adapter Designer. In addition, the Application Administrator tool is a browser-based application that provides you with data management and business object administration. Through a convenient user interface, you can create, edit, and delete a broad range of business object information; configure business rules and business constants; and manage messaging, conflict detection and resolution, performance, and troubleshooting.
* Both the Adapter Designer and the Application Administrator tool employ intelligent-data adapters to manipulate data sources on servers.
* The Application Designer enables you to configure, assemble, customize, and build new applications without writing a single line of code. This tool uses the Application Framework to develop applications bound to data definitions in metadata by abstracting the application from the data living in the back end enterprise application.
